# hello-world
I'm a person that is getting back into coding.  Over the last few years I was dealing with getting acquainted with, and comfortable with my transition to ts.  Prior to that I was a developer using C++, Visual Basic, Oracle DB, MySql DB.  Initial apps were actual software distributed on first floppy disks and then cd's.  Typical projects were n=tier database design, c++ libraries, and VB front end's.  Always had an interest in the internet being able to remember the sound of AOL loading and userboards.  A lot has changed in the time I was away from my coca cola and keyboard coding...php3 was the last manual I had purchased.  Now I'm comfortable in all aspects of my life both personal and professional.  I just recently started my web dev company so I am here learning how up to speed with git to make version control and packing so much easier.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this first read-me.  Hopefully there will be manuy, many more to come with actual projects.
